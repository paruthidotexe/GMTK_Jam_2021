Hi there!

You purchased a bundle of assets - your assets are available on the asset store rather than in this package.

If you check the description of your bundle on the Asset Store, you will find links to the various parts 
of this bundle, having bought this bundle, these are now "free" to acquire. Once you have done this, you can
download the individual parts.

FAQ:
- Q: Why are they setup this way?
- A: We want to make it easier to update lots of packages over time and 
     make sure nothing is ever out of date. This ensures you're always getting the latest version
     of every invidual package, with all our fixes; and you don't need to download a huge package
     just to open one individual asset you might need.
